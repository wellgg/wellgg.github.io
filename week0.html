		<h3>Written by NitroGuy on September 17, 2017</h3>
		<p>Hi! This is the first weekly update thing, or the "zeroth" I guess. I'm gonna keep this first... zeroth one brief because it's 10:40 pm and I have school tomorrow. Bear with me here, I'm still trying to figure out the format of this thing.</p>
		<p>So we've had a few meetings throughout the week and we have a basic idea of what we want our game to be. We want a top-down RPG that takes place in a school setting, which will be based off of the high school we attend. Pry has started to work on a level editor that exports to JSON, Sir Loin has made some early sprites, and I've made some music drafts. Our script is mostly done and will be revised soon.</p>
		<p>I hope that this is enough to fill our zeroth entry. I promise to have a better update next time where I'll include some sprites and some music. Good night everyone! See you next week!</p>
